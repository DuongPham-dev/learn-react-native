## Difference between ScrollView and FlatList

- ScrollView and FlatList are both used to facilitate scrolling when items exceed the viewport. However, the key difference is that when rendering many items (more than 100 items), ScrollView may display all items at once, while FlatList will display a portion and lazily load the remaining items as you scroll down. As a result, you should use ScrollView for user interfaces with a fixed amount of scrolling, and FlatList for dynamic lists.
